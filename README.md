#  My favorite series is Breaking Bad 
## Breaking Bad is my favorite TV Series because the story is so good because the story has a lot of twist and unexpected moments. The characters are great and well-casted. Everytime i watch Breaking Bad i always feel engage because the story just keeps getting better as the season goes by. Plus the Breaking Bad series has an great prequel Better Call Saul which i'm currently watching right now. Watching Better Call Saul right now gives me more context on how the characters of Breaking Bad developed as the series goes by. The main character Walter White is a great character, because when you watch the show you'll see the development of a simple high school chemistry teacher transitions to the biggest drug lord of Albuquerque, New Mexico. You'll see how he's just a decent man teaching high schoolers chemistry turn into a one of the biggest manipulative drug lord of United States.
